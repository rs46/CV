          <p>
            I am an application engineer working for Ten Kate Racing. After
            working shortly as a ship propellor designer my interests moved to
            motorcycles. In 1998 I started as a prototyping engineer for
            motorcycle suspension units. Through this job I got in contact with
            motorcycle racing, and ever since I have been working in different
            national and international championships as a suspension support
            engineer and later on as data and application engineer. Winnig
            several national and world championship titles.
